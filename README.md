## LibrariesLibraries

To develop the backend of the Academlo_Meals application, the following libraries have been utilized:

- express: Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of robust and scalable APIs. It provides a minimalist approach with essential features, making it an ideal choice for building the backend of Academlo_Meals.

- express-rate-limit: This library adds rate-limiting functionality to Express, preventing abuse or unauthorized usage of the API by limiting the number of requests from a specific IP address within a defined time period.

- express-validator: Express-validator is a middleware library used for input validation and sanitization. It helps ensure that the incoming data meets the specified requirements, such as data type validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.

- pg: pg is a PostgreSQL client for Node.js. It allows Academlo_Meals to interact with the PostgreSQL database by executing queries and managing connections.

- pg-hstore: pg-hstore is a module that serializes and deserializes JSON data to and from a PostgreSQL hstore format. It is commonly used in conjunction with Sequelize to store and retrieve JSON-like data structures.

- sequelize: Sequelize is a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with databases, including PostgreSQL. Sequelize simplifies tasks such as defining models, querying data, and managing database relationships.

- bcryptjs: bcryptjs is a library used for password hashing and salting. It provides a secure way to store and compare passwords by generating cryptographically strong hash values.

- cors: cors (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a middleware that allows controlled access to resources from different domains. It enables Academlo_Meals to handle requests from multiple origins and ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend.

- dotenv: dotenv is a library that loads environment variables from a .env file into the Node.js application. It allows sensitive configuration details, such as database credentials or API keys, to be securely stored and accessed.

- helmet: Helmet is a security middleware that sets various HTTP headers to enhance the security of Express applications. It helps protect against common web vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

- jsonwebtoken: jsonwebtoken is a library used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It enables secure authentication and authorization by issuing tokens that contain encrypted user information.

- morgan: morgan is a logging middleware that provides request logging functionality. It logs HTTP requests to the console or a file, helping developers monitor and debug the backend application.

- perfect-express-sanitizer: perfect-express-sanitizer is a middleware that sanitizes user input by removing potential malicious code or harmful characters. It adds an extra layer of security to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- winston: winston is a versatile logging library for Node.js. It allows flexible configuration options, multiple transport options (such as console, file, or database), and supports logging at different levels (debug, info, warn, error). It assists in monitoring and troubleshooting the backend application effectively.

These libraries play a crucial role in enhancing the functionality, security, and reliability of the Academlo_Meals backend application.
